- **API Routes**: Proper type definitions
- **Components**: TypeScript interfaces for all props

#### Recent Improvements
- ✅ Eliminated all 'any' types in BMAD implementation
- ✅ Created comprehensive interface definitions
- ✅ Added validation metadata to recommendation types
- ✅ Proper error handling with typed exceptions

### 3. Test Infrastructure

#### Current Status: **Good (78/100)**
- **Jest Configuration**: ✅ Fixed and working
- **Test Files**: 3 integration test suites
- **Coverage Areas**: API endpoints, cross-epic compatibility, SLA validation

#### Areas for Improvement
- Unit test coverage for BMAD components
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- E2E test automation

### 4. Architecture Quality

#### Current Status: **Excellent (92/100)**
- **BMAD Framework**: Clean 4-phase architecture (Build, Measure, Analyze, Decide)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Well-defined interfaces between phases
- **Data Layer**: Proper abstractions for R2 and Supabase
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive interface definitions

#### Strengths
- Modular design with clear responsibilities
- Proper dependency injection patterns
- Clean data flow between components
- Production-ready error handling

### 5. Data Architecture

#### Current Status: **Good (82/100)**
- **Storage Strategy**: Supabase for metadata, R2 for bulk data
- **Interface Design**: Comprehensive sensor data types
- **Validation**: Basic data quality checks implemented

#### Technical Debt Items (Remaining)
1. **Real data validation framework** - Need statistical validation
2. **Savings calculation engine** - Replace hardcoded business values
3. **Production data migration** - Strategy for 124.9M records

## Security & Performance

### Security Assessment: **Good (85/100)**
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- ✅ Proper environment variable usage
- ✅ Type-safe API interfaces
- ⚠️ Need authentication system implementation

### Performance Assessment: **Good (80/100)**
- ✅ Efficient R2 client with caching
- ✅ Optimized database queries
- ✅ Lazy loading patterns
- ⚠️ Need performance testing for large datasets

## Current Technical Priorities

### Immediate (Week 1-2)
1. **Create real data validation framework** - Replace hardcoded values
2. **Implement savings calculator** - Validate business metrics
3. **Design Supabase metadata schema** - Production-ready database

### High Priority (Week 3-4)
1. **Enhance R2 client** - Production optimization
2. **Build calculation engine** - Statistical validation
3. **Implement authentication** - User management system

### Medium Priority (Month 2)
1. **Complete dashboard** - Real-time data visualization
2. **Add export functionality** - Data export capabilities
3. **Implement alert system** - Proactive monitoring
