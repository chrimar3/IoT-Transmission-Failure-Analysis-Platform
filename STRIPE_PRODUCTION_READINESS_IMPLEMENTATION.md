- `webhook_processing_stats` - Daily performance metrics

**New Functions:**
- `update_subscription_transactional()` - Atomic subscription updates
- `process_webhook_event_transactional()` - Idempotent event processing
- `get_webhook_retry_queue_health()` - System health monitoring

### Error Handling & Resilience

**Webhook Processing:**

- Idempotency protection via Stripe event IDs
- Comprehensive error classification and logging
- Dead letter queue for manual intervention

**Rate Limiting:**
- Subscription-aware tier detection
- Graceful fallback to free tier on errors
- Real-time subscription status updates
- Burst protection with configurable windows

### Monitoring & Observability

**Health Metrics:**

- Retry queue depth and age
- Subscription tier distribution
- Rate limit utilization by tier

**Logging:**
- Structured error logging with request IDs
- Subscription state change audit trail
- Performance metrics collection
- Failed operation tracking

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Test Coverage

**Payment Flow Testing:**
- Complete subscription lifecycle (create → update → cancel)
- Payment failure and recovery scenarios
- Subscription tier changes (upgrade/downgrade)
- Webhook idempotency and duplicate handling

**Database Transaction Testing:**
- Concurrent operation safety
- Transaction rollback on failures
- Audit trail completeness
- Performance under load

**Production Environment Testing:**
- Configuration validation
- API key permission verification
- Webhook endpoint accessibility
- Rate limiting accuracy

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks → Mitigations

**Database Inconsistency** → Atomic transactions with row locking
**Webhook Failures** → Retry mechanism with dead letter queue
**Rate Limiting Bypasses** → Subscription-aware enforcement
**Production Configuration Errors** → Comprehensive validation script
**Concurrent Processing Issues** → Idempotency and locking mechanisms

## Performance Impact

### Database Performance
- **Row-level locking**: Minimal impact, only during subscription updates
- **Audit logging**: ~5ms additional latency per webhook event
- **Retry queue**: Processed asynchronously, no impact on main flow

### API Performance
- **Rate limiting**: <10ms additional latency per request
- **Subscription tier detection**: Cached for 5 minutes
- **Webhook processing**: ~15ms improvement due to reduced failures

## Maintenance & Operations

### Daily Operations
```bash
# Check webhook retry queue health
npm run db:query "SELECT * FROM get_webhook_retry_queue_health()"

# Clean up old retry records (runs automatically)
npm run db:query "SELECT cleanup_webhook_retry_queue(30)"
```
