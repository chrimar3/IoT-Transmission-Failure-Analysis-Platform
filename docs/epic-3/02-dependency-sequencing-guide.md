# Epic 3: Dependency Sequencing & Integration Guide

**DEPENDENCY STATUS**: Critical gaps identified - Sequencing requirements mandatory

## Dependency Analysis Summary

Epic 3's success depends on precise sequencing of dependencies and integration points. Critical gaps have been identified between Epic 1/2 foundations and Professional tier requirements. This guide establishes the mandatory sequencing for successful Epic 3 delivery.

## Foundation Dependencies (Epic 1 & 2)

### Epic 1 Integration Requirements
**Status**: CRITICAL - Must validate before Story 3.1 begins

#### Authentication System Integration
- [ ] **Professional Tier Access Control**: Validate Epic 1 auth system properly restricts Professional features
- [ ] **API Key Management**: Confirm Epic 1 user management supports API key generation and scoping
- [ ] **Subscription Tier Validation**: Test Epic 1 subscription checking for Professional vs Free feature access
- [ ] **Session Management**: Validate Epic 1 sessions support extended Professional user workflows

**Integration Testing Required**:
```typescript
// Professional Tier Access Validation
describe('Epic 1 Integration - Professional Access', () => {
  test('Professional subscribers can access advanced analytics')
  test('Free subscribers blocked from API access')
  test('API key generation requires Professional subscription')
  test('Subscription downgrades disable Professional features')
})
```

#### Stripe Integration Validation
- [ ] **Professional Subscription Processing**: Confirm Epic 1 handles €29/month Professional tier billing
- [ ] **Upgrade/Downgrade Workflows**: Test subscription changes with feature access updates

   - Test data and user accounts configured
   - Monitoring and logging operational

### Phase 2: Development Dependencies (Sprint 3.1 - Days 1-3)
**Parallel to Story 3.1 & 3.2 Development**

1. **Infrastructure Preparation** (Days 1-2)
   - Production domain and SSL setup
   - Third-party service configuration
   - Monitoring tools integration
   - Security scanning setup

2. **Customer Success Preparation** (Days 2-3)
   - Support system configuration

   - Complete production infrastructure validation
   - Security hardening and compliance verification
   - Performance benchmarking in production
   - Backup and disaster recovery testing

2. **Launch Preparation** (Day 5)
   - Final integration testing with all dependencies
   - Customer success system validation
   - Launch readiness assessment
   - Go/No-Go decision preparation

## Critical Path Dependencies

### Blocker Identification
**These dependencies will block Epic 3 if not resolved**:

1. **Epic 1 Professional Tier Support**
   - If Epic 1 cannot properly restrict Professional features → Epic 3 blocked
   - If Stripe integration cannot handle €29/month billing → Epic 3 blocked
   - If API key management not supported → Story 3.1 blocked

2. **Epic 2 Performance Scalability**
   - If Bangkok dataset cannot handle 10K requests/hour → Story 3.1 blocked
   - If analytics engine cannot support pattern detection → Story 3.2 blocked
   - If dashboard becomes unresponsive with Professional features → Story 3.2 blocked

3. **Production Infrastructure Availability**
   - If custom domain/SSL not configured → Story 3.3 blocked
   - If monitoring tools not integrated → Production launch blocked
   - If third-party services not configured → Customer experience blocked

### Non-Blocking Dependencies
**These can be resolved in parallel without blocking development**:

- Customer support documentation and knowledge base
- Educational video content and tutorials
- Advanced customer success metrics
- Post-launch marketing materials

## Integration Testing Strategy

### Epic 1 Integration Tests
```typescript
// Comprehensive Epic 1 Integration
describe('Epic 1 Professional Integration', () => {
  test('Professional subscription unlocks API access')
  test('Free users cannot generate API keys')
  test('Subscription changes update feature access immediately')
  test('Payment failures disable Professional features gracefully')
  test('API authentication uses Epic 1 user management')
})
```

### Epic 2 Integration Tests
```typescript
// Comprehensive Epic 2 Integration
describe('Epic 2 Analytics Integration', () => {
  test('Professional analytics build on Epic 2 foundation')
  test('API endpoints return Epic 2 Bangkok dataset')
  test('Advanced features maintain Epic 2 performance standards')
  test('Pattern detection uses Epic 2 statistical calculations')
  test('Export functionality leverages Epic 2 data structures')
})
```

### End-to-End Integration Tests
```typescript
// Complete Professional User Journey
describe('Complete Professional Integration', () => {
  test('User upgrades to Professional and gains API access')
  test('API access works with advanced analytics features')
  test('Professional features integrate seamlessly with core platform')
  test('Subscription management affects all Professional capabilities')
})
```

## Risk Mitigation for Dependencies

### Mitigation Strategy 1: Early Validation
**Approach**: Validate all Epic 1 & 2 integration points before Epic 3 development
**Timeline**: 2 days before Sprint 3.1
**Success Criteria**: All integration tests pass with documented evidence

### Mitigation Strategy 2: Parallel Infrastructure Setup
**Approach**: Set up production infrastructure parallel to development
**Timeline**: Days 1-3 of Sprint 3.1
**Success Criteria**: Production environment ready for Story 3.3 deployment

### Mitigation Strategy 3: Incremental Integration Testing
**Approach**: Test integration at each Epic 3 story completion
**Timeline**: End of each story development
**Success Criteria**: No integration regressions discovered at story boundaries

## Success Metrics

### Integration Success Indicators
- [ ] Epic 1 integration tests pass at 100% success rate
- [ ] Epic 2 performance maintains <500ms response under Professional load
- [ ] Production infrastructure supports all Epic 3 features
- [ ] No critical dependency gaps discovered during development

### Dependency Resolution Timeline
- **Day -2**: Epic 1 integration validated
- **Day -1**: Epic 2 scalability confirmed
- **Day 0**: Development environment ready
- **Day 3**: Production infrastructure operational
- **Day 5**: All dependencies resolved and validated

## Escalation Triggers

**Immediate Escalation Required If**:
- Epic 1 cannot support Professional tier requirements
- Epic 2 performance degrades under Professional load
- Production infrastructure cannot be configured within timeline
- Any critical path dependency cannot be resolved

**Escalation Process**:
1. Document specific dependency blocker with technical details
2. Assess impact on Epic 3 timeline and success criteria
3. Present alternative solutions with timeline/resource implications
4. Obtain approval for dependency resolution approach
