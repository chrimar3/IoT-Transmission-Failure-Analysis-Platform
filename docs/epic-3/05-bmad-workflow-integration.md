- ✅ Load testing framework for 100+ concurrent Professional users
- ✅ Security validation protocols with penetration testing requirements
- ✅ Performance benchmarking with automated monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Quality gates preventing development progression without validation

### PO Agent Analysis - CONDITIONAL GO WITH 4 BLOCKING ISSUES
**Status**: INTEGRATED into critical blocking issues resolution framework

#### Critical Blocking Issues Now Addressed:
1. **Early Test Strategy Gap** → Package 0: Critical Issue Resolution
   - Pre-development QA environment setup mandatory
   - Comprehensive test suite implementation required
   - Epic 1 & 2 integration validation before development begins

2. **Dependency Sequencing Gaps** → Dependency Sequencing Guide created
   - Epic 1 authentication validation for Professional tier access
   - Epic 2 analytics foundation scalability confirmation
   - External dependency timeline management integrated

3. **Production Launch Infrastructure** → Package 3: Production Infrastructure
   - Blue-green deployment with automated rollback capability
   - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems
   - Security hardening and incident response procedures

4. **Customer Success Gap** → Package 4: Customer Success Systems
   - Professional tier onboarding and educational content
   - Support system with <24 hour response time requirements
   - Success metrics tracking and customer health monitoring

#### PO Resolution Framework:
- ✅ **CONDITIONAL GO** criteria converted to actionable GO/NO-GO gates
- ✅ **Risk Mitigation** strategies embedded in work package execution
- ✅ **Dependency Management** with critical path and blocker identification
- ✅ **Quality Assurance** integrated throughout development lifecycle

### Document Alignment Analysis - CRITICAL DEPENDENCY GAPS
**Status**: RESOLVED through structured dependency management and sequencing

#### Document Alignment Issues Resolved:
- **Epic 1 Integration**: Professional tier access control validation mandatory
- **Epic 2 Foundation**: Bangkok dataset scalability confirmation required
- **Production Infrastructure**: External service configuration timeline managed
- **Customer Success**: Support system readiness integrated with technical delivery

#### Alignment Validation Framework:
- ✅ **Cross-Epic Integration Testing** mandatory before development begins
- ✅ **Foundation Validation** ensures Professional features build properly on Epic 1 & 2
- ✅ **External Dependencies** managed with parallel work streams
- ✅ **Documentation Consistency** maintained across all work packages
