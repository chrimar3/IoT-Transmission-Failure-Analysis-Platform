### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/4.1-custom-alert-configuration.yml

**Primary Concern**: Missing comprehensive test coverage for such a critical system component.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Implement comprehensive test suite before production deployment

**Rationale**: While the implementation quality is exceptional, the lack of comprehensive tests for a critical alert system poses significant risk. The complexity and importance of this system requires thorough test coverage before production deployment.

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement comprehensive test suite (estimated 2-3 days)
2. Validate alert evaluation accuracy with Bangkok dataset
3. Performance testing with realistic alert volumes
4. Re-review after test implementation
