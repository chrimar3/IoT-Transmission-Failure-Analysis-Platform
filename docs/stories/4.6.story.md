## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 4.4 (Multi-tenant Data Isolation):** Comprehensive security monitoring and resource usage tracking systems provide the foundation for operational monitoring documentation. The audit logging and performance monitoring implementations will require detailed operational procedures. [Source: Previous story context]

**From Story 4.7 (Production Monitoring & Alerts):** Real-time alerting system and performance measurement framework will require detailed operational playbooks for alert response and system health management. [Source: Story dependency context]

### Production Readiness Requirements
**Deployment Automation:** All deployment procedures must be documented with automated scripts where possible. Manual steps must include verification checkpoints and rollback procedures. Critical path deployments require multiple approval stages with detailed checklists.

**Operational Monitoring:** 24/7 monitoring coverage with clear escalation procedures. All critical alerts must have documented response procedures with target response times. System health dashboards must provide clear status indicators for non-technical stakeholders.

**Knowledge Transfer:** Documentation must enable new system administrators to become operational within 48 hours. All procedures must include prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, verification steps, and troubleshooting guidance.

**Business Continuity:** Disaster recovery procedures must ensure <5 minute RTO for critical services and <1 hour RPO for data recovery. All recovery procedures must be tested quarterly with documented results.
