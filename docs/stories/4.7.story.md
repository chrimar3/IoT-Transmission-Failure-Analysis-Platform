The incident response procedures and troubleshooting guides will be integrated with the automated alerting system for streamlined operations. [Source: Previous story context]

**From Story 4.4 (Multi-tenant Data Isolation):** Multi-tenant performance monitoring and resource usage tracking implementations provide the foundation for tenant-specific alerting and monitoring. The audit logging and security monitoring systems will integrate with the comprehensive monitoring stack. [Source: Previous story context]

### Production Monitoring Requirements
**System Reliability:** 99.9% uptime target requires comprehensive monitoring across all system components with automated failover and incident response. Critical alerts must have <5 minute response time with automated escalation procedures for unacknowledged alerts.

**Performance Standards:** Core Web Vitals must meet industry standards (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1) with continuous monitoring and alerting. API response times must average <500ms with P95 <1s for optimal user experience.

**User Impact Focus:** All monitoring and alerting must be configured based on user impact severity rather than technical metrics alone. Customer-facing services require higher monitoring thresholds and faster response times.

**Scalability Monitoring:** System must monitor and alert on capacity thresholds to enable proactive scaling decisions. Database performance, API rate limits, and infrastructure resource usage require automated monitoring.
