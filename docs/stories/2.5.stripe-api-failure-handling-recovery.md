# Story 2.5: Stripe API Failure Handling & Recovery

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** robust Stripe failure handling so that payment processing remains reliable even during service outages,
**so that** users can maintain uninterrupted access to subscription services and administrators can quickly resolve payment discrepancies.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed Stripe API calls (base delay 1s, max 3 attempts)
2. Dead letter queue for failed webhook processing with automatic retry after 5 minutes
3. Graceful degradation during Stripe outages with cached subscription status (24-hour TTL)
4. Manual reconciliation dashboard for payment discrepancies with admin-only access
5. User-friendly error messages for payment failures with actionable next steps
6. Comprehensive failure monitoring with real-time alerts for critical payment issues
7. Webhook signature verification with automatic rejection of invalid requests
8. Payment status recovery mechanisms for users affected by temporary outages
9. Administrative tools for manual payment processing during extended outages
10. Performance benchmarks: Failure recovery <30s, manual reconciliation <2 minutes
