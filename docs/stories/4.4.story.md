## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 2.1 (NextAuth.js Authentication):** User authentication context and session management patterns will be critical for RLS implementation. The auth.users table structure and session handling provide the foundation for tenant isolation. [Source: Previous story context]

**From Story 2.3 (Tiered Access Control):** Subscription tier validation middleware provides patterns for implementing resource quotas and access controls that will be extended for multi-tenant resource monitoring. [Source: Previous story context]

### Production Readiness Requirements
**API Failure Handling:** All database operations must include comprehensive error handling with proper tenant context validation. Failed queries should not leak information about other tenants. Implement retry logic for transient database failures without compromising isolation.

**Service Rate Limit Monitoring:** Monitor Supabase free tier limits (500MB storage, 2GB bandwidth, 100 concurrent connections) with automated alerting at 80% capacity. Implement graceful degradation when approaching limits.

**Error Logging:** All security-related errors, unauthorized access attempts, and resource limit violations must be logged with detailed context for security analysis. Error messages must not reveal information about other tenants.

**Performance Benchmarks:** Database queries must maintain <500ms average response time. RLS policy evaluation overhead should not exceed 50ms. Support 100+ concurrent authenticated users without performance degradation.

**Security Requirements:** All data access must be authenticated and authorized through RLS policies. No direct database access bypassing row-level security. All audit events must be immutable and tamper-evident.

**Monitoring Requirements:** Real-time monitoring of security events, resource usage, and performance metrics. Automated alerting for anomalous access patterns, resource violations, and security incidents.

**Documentation Requirements:** Complete operational runbooks for backup/recovery, security incident response, and capacity management procedures.

### Data Models
**Primary Database Schema Extensions:** [Source: architecture/7-database-schema-bangkok-dataset-optimized.md]

**Row Level Security Policies Required:**
```sql
-- Sensor readings isolation by user context
CREATE POLICY "sensor_readings_isolation" ON sensor_readings
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Subscriptions isolation
CREATE POLICY "subscriptions_isolation" ON subscriptions
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Export jobs isolation
CREATE POLICY "export_jobs_isolation" ON export_jobs
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

**Resource Monitoring Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE tenant_resource_usage (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    resource_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'queries', 'connections', 'storage'
    usage_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
    measurement_window TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE security_audit_log (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    resource VARCHAR(100),
    success BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    session_id VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
