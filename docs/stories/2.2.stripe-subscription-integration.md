# Story 2.2: Stripe Subscription Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to upgrade to Professional tier,
**so that** I can access advanced analytics features and full data export capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Stripe checkout for Professional tier ($29/month) with secure payment processing
2. Webhook handling for subscription events (created, updated, cancelled, payment_failed)
3. Subscription status tracking with real-time database updates
4. Automatic access control based on subscription tier with immediate effect
5. Cancellation and refund handling with graceful service degradation
6. Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed Stripe API calls (P0 requirement)
7. Dead letter queue for failed webhook processing with manual reconciliation
8. User-friendly error messages for payment failures and service outages
9. Comprehensive error logging and alerting for payment processing failures
10. Performance benchmarks: Payment processing <2s, webhook processing <5s

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on the foundation established by:
- Story 2.1: NextAuth.js authentication provides user session management and secure authentication
- Story 1.4: Core API endpoints provide the API infrastructure and error handling patterns
- Story 1.2: Database schema includes subscriptions table for tracking subscription data

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/7-database-schema-bangkok-dataset-optimized.md]

**Subscription Table**: subscriptions
- id: UUID PRIMARY KEY (unique subscription identifier)
- user_id: UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) (links to NextAuth user)
- tier: VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'free' (subscription tier: 'free' | 'professional')
- stripe_subscription_id: VARCHAR(100) (Stripe subscription ID for API calls)
- status: VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active' (subscription status: 'active' | 'cancelled' | 'past_due')
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
- expires_at: TIMESTAMPTZ (for subscription expiration tracking)

**Extended Fields for Webhook Tracking**:
- stripe_customer_id: VARCHAR(100) (Stripe customer ID)
- current_period_start: TIMESTAMPTZ (billing cycle start)
- current_period_end: TIMESTAMPTZ (billing cycle end)
- cancel_at_period_end: BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
- last_webhook_event: VARCHAR(50) (last processed webhook event type)
- webhook_updated_at: TIMESTAMPTZ (last webhook processing time)

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/8-api-architecture.md]

**Core Subscription Endpoints**:
- GET /api/subscription/status - Current subscription tier and status information
- POST /api/subscription/checkout - Create Stripe checkout session for Professional tier
- POST /api/subscription/cancel - Cancel subscription with graceful degradation
- POST /api/webhooks/stripe - Handle Stripe webhook events with signature verification

**Stripe Integration Requirements**:
- Professional tier: $29/month subscription with 10,000 requests/hour API access
- Payment processing with PCI DSS compliance via Stripe
- Webhook endpoint security with Stripe signature verification
- Comprehensive error handling for payment failures and API outages

**Rate Limiting Integration**:
- Free tier: 100 requests/hour
- Professional tier: 10,000 requests/hour
- Subscription status affects rate limiting immediately upon status changes

**Stripe API Failure Handling** [Source: architecture/8-api-architecture.md]:
- Payment Processing: Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts max)
- Webhook Failures: Dead letter queue with manual reconciliation dashboard
- Service Outages: Graceful degradation with limited access during outages
- Network Issues: Local caching of subscription status (24-hour TTL)

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Stripe Client Configuration**:
```typescript
// src/lib/stripe.ts
import Stripe from 'stripe';

export const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, {
  apiVersion: '2023-10-16',
  typescript: true,
});

export const getStripeCustomer = async (userId: string): Promise<string> => {
  // Customer creation and retrieval logic
};
```

**Webhook Route Structure**:
```typescript
// src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { headers } from 'next/headers';
import { stripe } from '@/lib/stripe';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.text();
  const signature = headers().get('stripe-signature')!;
  
  try {
    const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
      body,
      signature,
      process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!
    );
    
    // Process webhook event with proper error handling
    await processWebhookEvent(event);
    
    return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
  } catch (error) {
    // Comprehensive error logging and response
  }
}
```
