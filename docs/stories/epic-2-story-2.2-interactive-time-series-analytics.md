## Dev Notes

### Bangkok Dataset Time-Series Coverage
- **Time Range**: January 2018 - June 2019 (18 months)
- **Sensor Types**: HVAC, Lighting, Power, Security, Elevators (144 sensors)
- **Data Frequency**: 5-minute intervals (124.9M data points)
- **Statistical Features**: Moving averages, standard deviations, trend analysis

### Epic 1 & Story 2.1 Integration Points
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js session for personalized views
- **Subscription Tiers**: Professional export features gated
- **Statistical Framework**: Reuse `ConfidenceInterval` interface from Story 2.1
- **Component Patterns**: Follow `StatisticalMetricCard` architecture

### Technical Implementation Requirements
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Charts**: Recharts or Victory.js for statistical visualizations
- **Data Hooks**: Custom `useTimeSeriesData` hook for efficient fetching
- **Performance**: Data decimation and progressive loading for 124.9M points
- **Professional Gating**: Export features behind €29/month subscription

### Component Architecture
**Dashboard Page**: `/src/app/dashboard/time-series/page.tsx`
**Chart Components**: `/src/components/features/time-series/`
- `InteractiveTimeSeriesChart.tsx` - main chart container
- `TimeRangeSelector.tsx` - zoom level controls
- `SensorLegend.tsx` - multi-sensor selection
- `AnomalyHighlight.tsx` - confidence-based anomalies
- `ChartExporter.tsx` - Professional export features

### Performance Optimization Strategy
- **Data Decimation**: Reduce points based on zoom level
- **Progressive Loading**: Load visible range first
- **Chart Virtualization**: Render only visible portion
- **Memory Management**: Clear old data on zoom changes
- **CDN Caching**: Cache aggregated historical data

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Charts interact smoothly with 100K+ data points
- [ ] All zoom/pan operations respond within 100ms
- [ ] Professional export functionality working
- [ ] Statistical accuracy validated against source
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for extended sessions
- [ ] Mobile responsive with touch interactions
- [ ] All tests passing with >90% coverage
