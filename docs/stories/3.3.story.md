## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 3.2 Implementation:** Chart performance optimization patterns, data decimation strategies for large datasets, and API response time requirements established. These patterns will be essential for the pattern detection engine's real-time processing capabilities.

**Key Learning:** Bangkok dataset handling (100,000+ data points per sensor) requires careful memory management and progressive loading strategies that apply to ML algorithm processing.

### Data Models

CREATE TABLE sensor_readings (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    sensor_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    floor_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    equipment_type VARCHAR(100),
    reading_value DECIMAL(10,4),
    unit VARCHAR(20),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'normal'
);
```
