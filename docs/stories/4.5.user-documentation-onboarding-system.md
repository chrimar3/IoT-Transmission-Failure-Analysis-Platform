## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**From Epic 3 (Core Analytics Dashboard):** User interface patterns and navigation structure are established, providing the foundation for contextual help integration. The dashboard component architecture will be extended to include help tooltips and guided tours. [Source: Previous epic context]

**From Story 2.1 (NextAuth.js Authentication):** User authentication and subscription tier detection will be critical for personalizing onboarding experiences and controlling access to tier-specific documentation. [Source: Story 2.1 context]

### Production Readiness Requirements

**API Failure Handling:** Documentation system must gracefully handle content loading failures with fallback mechanisms. Implement retry logic for video loading and provide cached content for offline scenarios. Search functionality must continue working during service disruptions with local indexing.

**Performance Benchmarks:** Documentation pages must load in <2 seconds on 3G connections. Video tutorials must start streaming within 3 seconds. Search results must return in <300ms. Knowledge base articles must be indexed for instant search response.

**Security Requirements:** All documentation content must be served over HTTPS. User feedback and comments require authentication and input sanitization. Video content must be protected from unauthorized access and embedded safely without XSS vulnerabilities.

**Monitoring Requirements:** Track documentation usage analytics, search queries, and user engagement metrics. Monitor video streaming performance and buffering rates. Alert on documentation errors, broken links, and user feedback sentiment.

**Documentation Requirements:** Complete operational runbooks for content management, video hosting, and documentation update workflows. Include content review processes and accessibility compliance procedures.
