# Epic 3: Basic Analytics Dashboard - Ultra-Lean MVP

**Duration**: Week 3  
**Goal**: Create basic analytics dashboard for value validation  
**Business Value**: Demonstrate core value proposition to all users  

## Epic Overview

This epic implements a basic analytics dashboard that demonstrates the value of the Bangkok CU-BEMS dataset. Focus on the most essential features that validate the core value proposition without complexity.

## Stories

### Story 3.1: Executive Summary Dashboard

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) displayed prominently
- Building health score with clear visual indicators
- Current alerts and notifications summary
- Quick access to most critical issues
- Responsive design for mobile executives
- Real-time data updates every 5 minutes

**Tasks**:
1. Design executive summary layout with UX best practices
2. Implement KPI calculation algorithms
3. Create building health scoring system
4. Add alert prioritization and display
5. Implement auto-refresh functionality
6. Add mobile-responsive design

### Story 3.2: Interactive Time-Series Visualizations
**Priority**: P0 (Product Critical)  
**Effort**: 6 points  

**User Story**: As a facility engineer, I need interactive time-series charts so that I can analyze energy consumption patterns and identify optimization opportunities.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Multiple sensor data streams on single chart
- Zoom and pan functionality for detailed analysis
- Date range selector (hour, day, week, month, custom)
- Data point tooltips with contextual information
- Export chart as PNG/PDF for reports
- Performance optimized for large datasets

**Tasks**:
1. Select and integrate charting library (Chart.js or D3.js)
2. Implement multi-series time-series charts
3. Add interactive zoom and pan controls
4. Create date range picker component
5. Implement chart export functionality
6. Optimize for Bangkok dataset performance

### Story 3.3: Simple Data Export
**Priority**: P1 (Value Validation)  
**Effort**: 3 points  

**User Story**: As a building analyst, I need to export basic data so that I can analyze it externally or share with colleagues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Export filtered time-series data as CSV
- Export dashboard charts as PNG images
- Simple date range filtering for exports
- Download functionality working reliably

**Tasks**:
1. Implement CSV export for time-series data
2. Add chart image export (PNG)
3. Create date range filtering for exports
4. Add basic export UI components

**Deferred Features (Post-MVP)**:
- Advanced pattern detection algorithms
- PDF report generation
- Scheduled reports and email delivery
- Complex export templates

## Ultra-Lean Feature Priorities

### Core Features (Must Have)
- Executive summary with basic building metrics
- Simple time-series charts showing energy consumption
- CSV data export for basic analysis
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet viewing

### Deferred Features (Post-MVP)
- Advanced anomaly detection and pattern analysis
- Complex interactive chart features
- PDF report generation and scheduling
- Email alerts and notifications
- Machine learning-based predictions
- Custom dashboard builder
- Real-time streaming updates
- Multi-building comparisons

## Technical Implementation Details

### Chart Performance Optimization
```typescript
// Implement data decimation for large datasets
const optimizeDataPoints = (data: DataPoint[], maxPoints: number) => {
  if (data.length <= maxPoints) return data;
  
  const step = Math.ceil(data.length / maxPoints);
  return data.filter((_, index) => index % step === 0);
};

// Use React.memo for expensive chart components
const TimeSeriesChart = React.memo(({ data, ...props }) => {
  const optimizedData = useMemo(
    () => optimizeDataPoints(data, 1000),
    [data]
  );
  
  return <Chart data={optimizedData} {...props} />;
});
```

### Anomaly Detection Algorithm (MVP)
```typescript
// Simple statistical anomaly detection
const detectAnomalies = (readings: number[], threshold: number = 2) => {
  const mean = readings.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / readings.length;
  const stdDev = Math.sqrt(
    readings.reduce((sum, val) => sum + Math.pow(val - mean, 2), 0) / readings.length
  );
  
  return readings.map((value, index) => ({
    index,
    value,
    isAnomaly: Math.abs(value - mean) > threshold * stdDev,
    severity: Math.abs(value - mean) / stdDev
  }));
};
```

## Definition of Done - Ultra-Lean

- [ ] Executive dashboard loads and displays basic metrics
- [ ] Time-series charts display Bangkok dataset correctly
- [ ] CSV export works for filtered data
- [ ] Basic responsive design works on mobile devices
- [ ] Dashboard accessible to authenticated users
- [ ] Basic error handling for data loading issues

**Deferred to Post-MVP**:
- Advanced performance optimization
- Complex anomaly detection
- Comprehensive accessibility compliance
- Advanced export formats
- Detailed user testing
- Production monitoring and alerting

## Dependencies

**Upstream**: 
- Epic 1 (Core Data Foundation) - requires API endpoints
- Epic 2 (Authentication) - requires subscription tier access

**Downstream**: Epic 4 (Advanced Features) - uses dashboard foundation  

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Chart performance with large Bangkok dataset  
**Mitigation**: Implement data decimation and virtualization techniques

**Risk**: Complex anomaly detection accuracy  
**Mitigation**: Start with simple statistical methods, iterate based on user feedback

**Risk**: Mobile performance on lower-end devices  
**Mitigation**: Progressive loading and simplified mobile layouts
