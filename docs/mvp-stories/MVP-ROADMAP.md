## 🎯 Key Decisions

### **What We're Building**
1. **Simple, functional dashboard** showing Bangkok building data
2. **Basic user authentication** (Google OAuth only)
3. **Core analytics features** (charts, metrics, exports)
4. **Minimal viable documentation** and support

### **What We're NOT Building (Yet)**
1. **No payment processing** - everyone gets full access
2. **No complex features** - just the essentials
3. **No enterprise features** - focus on core users
4. **No performance optimization** - functional first

### **Why This Approach**
- **Faster to market** (4 weeks vs 6+ weeks)
- **Lower complexity** = fewer bugs
- **User feedback first** before monetization
- **Pivot-friendly** based on actual usage
- **Resource efficient** for solo developer

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Start Week 1 Development**
   - Set up Next.js project
   - Configure Supabase
   - Process Bangkok dataset
   - Create basic API endpoints

2. **Recruit Beta Users**
   - Identify 20-30 target users
   - Prepare onboarding materials
   - Set up feedback collection

3. **Development Environment**
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest cu-bems-mvp --typescript --tailwind --app
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js next-auth
   npm install -D @testing-library/react jest
   ```

4. **Track Progress**
   - Daily standups (even solo)
   - Weekly demos to stakeholders
   - Continuous user feedback

## 🎉 Remember

**Ship Early, Ship Often**
- It's better to have 20 users on a simple product than 0 users on a complex one
- User feedback > Perfect features
- Done > Perfect

**This is Version 0.1, Not 1.0**
- MVP = Minimum Viable Product
- Validate first, optimize later
- Every feature should earn its complexity
