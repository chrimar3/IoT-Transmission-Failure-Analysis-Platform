# Epic 2: Simple User Authentication - Ultra-Lean MVP

**Duration**: Week 2  
**Goal**: Implement basic user authentication with single access level  
**Business Value**: Enable user identification and personalized experience  

## Epic Overview

This epic establishes basic user authentication without any payment or subscription complexity. All authenticated users get full access to validate core value proposition.

## Stories

### Story 2.1: NextAuth.js Authentication Setup
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking)  
**Effort**: 4 points  

**User Story**: As a user, I need to create an account and login so that I can access personalized analytics features.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Email/password registration and login
- Google OAuth integration
- Secure session management
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management

**Tasks**:
1. Configure NextAuth.js with Supabase adapter
2. Implement email/password authentication
3. Add Google OAuth provider
4. Create user registration flow
5. Add password reset functionality

### Story 2.2: Basic User Profile Management
**Priority**: P1 (Nice to Have)  
**Effort**: 2 points  

**User Story**: As a user, I want to manage my profile so that I can personalize my experience.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- View and edit basic profile information
- Change email address with verification
- Simple user preferences (display name, timezone)

**Tasks**:
1. Create user profile page
2. Implement profile editing functionality
3. Add email change verification
4. Add basic user preferences

**Deferred Features (Post-MVP)**:
- All payment and subscription functionality
- Tiered access control
- Rate limiting by user type
- Complex user management

## Ultra-Lean Authentication Model

### MVP Access Level (No Tiers)
**All Authenticated Users Get**:
- Full analytics dashboard access
- Complete historical data access
- Data export capabilities
- Email alerts and notifications
- API access (reasonable usage)

### Deferred Features (Post-MVP)
- All subscription and payment functionality
- Tiered access control
- Rate limiting
- Enterprise features
- Multi-tenant organization management

## Definition of Done - Ultra-Lean

- [ ] Users can register and authenticate via Google OAuth
- [ ] Basic user profile management working
- [ ] Single access level for all authenticated users
- [ ] Session management secure and functional
- [ ] Password reset flow working
- [ ] Basic error handling for authentication edge cases

**Deferred to Post-MVP**:
- Payment processing and subscriptions
- Tiered access control
- Rate limiting
- Advanced failure handling
- Complex user management

## Dependencies

**Upstream**: Epic 1 (Core Data Foundation) - requires API infrastructure  
**Downstream**: Epic 3 (Analytics Dashboard) - requires authentication for personalized features  

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Stripe webhook processing failures  
**Mitigation**: Implement webhook retry logic and manual reconciliation tools

**Risk**: Complex subscription state management  
**Mitigation**: Keep MVP simple with only two tiers, add complexity post-launch

**Risk**: Authentication security vulnerabilities  
**Mitigation**: Use battle-tested NextAuth.js with security best practices

## Success Metrics - Ultra-Lean

- User registration and login working reliably
- Zero authentication security incidents
- Simple authentication flow without friction
- Users can access all dashboard features after login

## Implementation Sequence

1. **Week 2 Day 1-2**: NextAuth.js setup and Google OAuth
2. **Week 2 Day 3-4**: User profile management
3. **Week 2 Day 5**: Authentication testing and edge cases

This ultra-lean approach focuses on core user identification needed for value validation while completely removing payment complexity until market demand is proven.
