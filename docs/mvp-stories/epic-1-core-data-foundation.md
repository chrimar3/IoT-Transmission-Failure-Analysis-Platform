# Epic 1: Core Data Foundation - Ultra-Lean MVP

**Duration**: Week 1  
**Goal**: Process Bangkok CU-BEMS dataset and create minimal API infrastructure  
**Business Value**: Enable basic data access for value validation  

## Epic Overview

This epic establishes the foundational data processing pipeline for the Bangkok CU-BEMS dataset (700MB, 4-6M data points) and creates the core API infrastructure required for the analytics platform.

## Stories

### Story 1.0: Testing Framework Installation & Configuration
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking - Must Complete First)  
**Effort**: 2 points  

**User Story**: As a developer, I need a complete testing framework setup so that all subsequent development follows TDD principles and maintains quality standards.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright installed and configured
- Test scripts in package.json functional  
- CI/CD pipeline includes automated testing
- Test coverage reporting configured
- Example tests demonstrate framework functionality

**Tasks**:
1. Install all testing dependencies (Jest, RTL, Playwright, Supertest)
2. Create jest.config.js with proper TypeScript and React support
3. Set up setupTests.js with common test utilities
4. Configure GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
5. Create example unit, integration, and E2E tests
6. Set up test coverage reporting and thresholds

### Story 1.1: Bangkok Dataset Processing Pipeline
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking)  
**Effort**: 5 points  

**User Story**: As a system administrator, I need an automated pipeline to process the Bangkok CU-BEMS CSV files so that the data is available for analytics queries.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- CSV validation script identifies data quality issues
- Automated processing handles both 2018 (215MB) and 2019 (483MB) files
- Data cleaning removes invalid/duplicate entries
- Processing logs provide detailed error reporting
- Pipeline can be run locally and in CI/CD

**Tasks**:
1. Create CSV validation script for Bangkok dataset format
2. Implement data cleaning and normalization
3. Add progress tracking for large file processing
4. Create error logging and reporting
5. Add unit tests for processing functions

### Story 1.2: PostgreSQL Database Schema Creation
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking)  
**Effort**: 3 points  

**User Story**: As a developer, I need a properly structured database schema so that sensor data can be efficiently stored and queried.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Schema supports Bangkok dataset structure (134 sensors, 7 floors)
- Optimized indexes for time-series queries
- Materialized views for common aggregations
- Migration scripts for schema updates
- Supports multi-tenant data isolation

**Tasks**:
1. Design sensor_readings table with proper indexing
2. Create materialized views for daily/hourly aggregates
3. Add database migration system
4. Create seed data for development
5. Add database performance testing

### Story 1.3: Supabase Integration & Data Import
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking)  
**Effort**: 4 points  

**User Story**: As a system, I need automated data import to Supabase so that processed data is available for the application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Automated import using pg_copy for performance
- Incremental updates for new data
- Data integrity validation after import
- Rollback capability for failed imports
- Environment-specific import (dev/staging/prod)

**Tasks**:
1. Set up Supabase project and connection
2. Implement batch import with pg_copy
3. Create incremental update mechanism
4. Add data integrity validation
5. Create import monitoring and alerts

### Story 1.4: Core API Endpoints
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking)  
**Effort**: 6 points  

**User Story**: As a frontend developer, I need RESTful API endpoints so that I can retrieve sensor data for visualizations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GET /api/readings/summary returns dashboard metrics
- GET /api/readings/timeseries supports date range filtering
- GET /api/readings/patterns identifies failure patterns
- All endpoints return consistent JSON structure
- Proper error handling and HTTP status codes

**Tasks**:
1. Create Next.js API route structure
2. Implement summary statistics endpoint
3. Implement time-series data endpoint
4. Add pattern detection algorithms
5. Create comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger specs
6. Generate interactive API documentation with examples and testing interface
7. Add API versioning strategy and endpoint documentation standards

### Story 1.5: Simple Deployment Setup  
**Priority**: P2 (Post-MVP)  
**Effort**: 1 point

**User Story**: As a developer, I need basic deployment so that the application is accessible for testing.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Vercel deployment with automatic SSL
- Basic environment variables configured
- Production database connection working

**Tasks**:
1. Deploy to Vercel with default domain
2. Configure production environment variables
3. Test deployment functionality

**Note**: Custom domain and comprehensive documentation deferred to post-MVP

## Definition of Done - Ultra-Lean

- [ ] Bangkok dataset processed and imported to Supabase
- [ ] Basic API endpoints functional
- [ ] Basic test coverage >70% for core functions
- [ ] Testing framework installed and configured (Story 1.0)
- [ ] Simple deployment working on Vercel
- [ ] Data accessible via API endpoints

**Deferred to Post-MVP**:
- Advanced error handling and resilience
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Custom domain setup
- Production monitoring and alerting
- Performance optimization

## Dependencies

**Upstream**: None (Epic 1 is foundational)  
**Downstream**: Epic 2 (User Authentication) requires API infrastructure  

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Large dataset processing performance  
**Mitigation**: Implement chunked processing with progress tracking

**Risk**: Data quality issues in Bangkok dataset  
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive validation with detailed error reporting

**Risk**: Supabase free tier limitations  
**Mitigation**: Monitor usage and implement data sampling for development

## Success Metrics - Ultra-Lean

- Data processing completes in <20 minutes for full dataset
- API endpoints respond (no strict performance requirements yet)
- Data integrity validated through basic checks
- Core functionality working for value validation
