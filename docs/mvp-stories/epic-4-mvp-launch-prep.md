## Dependencies

**Upstream**: Epics 1-3 must be complete  
**Downstream**: Post-MVP feature development based on user feedback  

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Users expect more features  
**Mitigation**: Clear communication about MVP status and roadmap

**Risk**: Production issues without monitoring  
**Mitigation**: Daily manual checks and user feedback channel

**Risk**: Poor user adoption  
**Mitigation**: Direct user engagement and rapid iteration

## Success Metrics - MVP

- Application accessible and stable
- 10+ beta users successfully onboarded
- Core value proposition validated
- User feedback collected for prioritization
- No critical production issues

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 4
- **Days 1-2**: Basic email alerts
- **Days 3**: User documentation
- **Days 4**: Error handling
- **Day 5**: Production deployment and testing

This ultra-lean approach ensures we launch quickly to validate the core concept before investing in advanced features.
