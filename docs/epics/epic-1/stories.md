- Incremental updates for new data
- Data integrity validation after import
- Rollback capability for failed imports
- Environment-specific import (dev/staging/prod)

**Tasks**:
1. Set up Supabase project and connection
2. Implement batch import with pg_copy
3. Create incremental update mechanism
4. Add data integrity validation
5. Create import monitoring and alerts

## Story 1.4: Core API Endpoints
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking)  
**Effort**: 6 points  

**User Story**: As a frontend developer, I need RESTful API endpoints so that I can retrieve sensor data for visualizations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GET /api/readings/summary returns dashboard metrics
- GET /api/readings/timeseries supports date range filtering
- GET /api/readings/patterns identifies failure patterns
- All endpoints return consistent JSON structure
- Proper error handling and HTTP status codes

**Tasks**:
1. Create Next.js API route structure
2. Implement summary statistics endpoint
3. Implement time-series data endpoint
4. Add pattern detection algorithms
5. Create comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger specs
6. Generate interactive API documentation with examples and testing interface
7. Add API versioning strategy and endpoint documentation standards

## Story 1.5: Domain Setup & DNS Configuration  
**Priority**: P1 (Launch Blocking)  
**Effort**: 2 points

**User Story**: As a product owner, I need the production domain configured so that users can access the application at a professional URL.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Domain registered and DNS configured
- SSL certificates active and auto-renewing  
- Subdomain strategy implemented
- Vercel deployment configured for custom domain
- Domain redirects working properly

**Tasks**:

2. Configure Vercel DNS settings
3. Set up SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
4. Configure subdomain routing (api, app, docs)
5. Test domain functionality and redirects

## Story 1.6: Comprehensive API Documentation & Standards  
**Priority**: P1 (Developer Critical)  
**Effort**: 3 points

**User Story**: As a developer (internal and external), I need comprehensive API documentation so that I can integrate with the platform APIs effectively and troubleshoot issues independently.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification generated for all endpoints
- Interactive API documentation accessible via web interface
- All endpoints include request/response examples with sample data
- Error response formats documented with HTTP status codes
- API versioning strategy documented and implemented
