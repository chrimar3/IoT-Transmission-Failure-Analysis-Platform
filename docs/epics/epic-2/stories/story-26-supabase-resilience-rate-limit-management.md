# Story 2.6: Supabase Resilience & Rate Limit Management
**Priority**: P0 (Production Critical)  
**Effort**: 3 points

**User Story**: As a system administrator, I need Supabase failure handling so that the application remains functional during database issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Connection pooling with automatic retry logic
- Read-only mode during database outages
- Rate limit monitoring with automatic throttling
- Cached data serving during outages
- Automated scaling alerts before hitting limits

**Tasks**:
1. Implement database connection pooling and retry logic
2. Create read-only mode with cached data serving
3. Add rate limit monitoring and automated throttling
4. Set up scaling alerts at 80% of service limits
5. Create fallback data serving mechanisms
