# Story 2.5: Stripe API Failure Handling & Recovery

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator and end user,
**I want** robust Stripe API failure handling and recovery mechanisms,
**so that** payment processing remains reliable even during service outages, webhook failures, and network issues, ensuring revenue protection and seamless user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Stripe API Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff retry mechanism for failed Stripe API calls with 3 attempts max (base delay 1s, max delay 8s)
2. **Dead Letter Queue**: Create webhook dead letter queue for failed webhook processing with automatic retry attempts and manual reconciliation capabilities
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Provide limited read-only access during Stripe service outages while maintaining core functionality
4. **Manual Reconciliation Dashboard**: Build administrative dashboard for resolving payment discrepancies and processing failed transactions
5. **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Display clear, actionable error messages for payment failures without exposing technical details
6. **Monitoring Integration**: Integrate with monitoring system for real-time alerts on payment processing failures and service degradation
7. **Webhook Replay Protection**: Implement idempotency and replay attack protection for webhook events
8. **Service Rate Limit Monitoring**: Monitor Stripe API rate limits with automated scaling triggers and user notifications
9. **Payment Status Caching**: Implement subscription status caching with 24-hour TTL for service resilience
10. **Performance Benchmarks**: Maintain payment processing <2s, failed payment recovery <30s, webhook processing <5s

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building upon the comprehensive Stripe integration established in:
- **Story 2.2**: Stripe Subscription Integration provides the foundational payment processing, webhook handling, and basic error handling infrastructure
- **Story 2.1**: NextAuth.js Authentication provides secure user session management and authentication context
- **Story 1.4**: Core API endpoints provide the API error handling patterns and response structures
- **Story 1.2**: Database schema includes subscriptions table and can be extended for failure tracking

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/7-database-schema-bangkok-dataset-optimized.md]

**Extended Subscription Table for Failure Tracking**:
```sql
-- Add failure tracking columns to existing subscriptions table
ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN last_failure_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN failure_reason TEXT;
ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN cached_status VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN cache_updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
```

**New Webhook Failures Table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE webhook_failures (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  stripe_event_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  failure_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
  retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  next_retry_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  resolved_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  resolved_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_webhook_failures_retry ON webhook_failures(next_retry_at) WHERE resolved_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_webhook_failures_event_type ON webhook_failures(event_type);
```

**Payment Reconciliation Table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_reconciliation (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  stripe_payment_intent_id VARCHAR(100),
  stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(100),
  expected_amount INTEGER,
  actual_amount INTEGER,
  discrepancy_type VARCHAR(50),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  resolution_notes TEXT,
  resolved_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  resolved_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

CREATE INDEX idx_payment_reconciliation_status ON payment_reconciliation(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_reconciliation_user ON payment_reconciliation(user_id);
```

  } catch (error) {
    // Add to dead letter queue for manual processing
    await addToDeadLetterQueue(event, error.message);
    await alertWebhookFailure(event, error);
    
    // Return success to prevent Stripe retries while we handle internally
    return NextResponse.json({ received: true, status: 'queued_for_retry' });
