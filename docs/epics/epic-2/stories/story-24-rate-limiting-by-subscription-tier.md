# Story 2.4: Rate Limiting by Subscription Tier
**Priority**: P1 (Performance)  
**Effort**: 3 points  

**User Story**: As a system administrator, I need API rate limiting so that free users don't overwhelm the system while paying users get priority access.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Free tier: 100 requests/hour
- Professional tier: 10,000 requests/hour
- Rate limit headers in API responses
- Clear error messages when limits exceeded
- Redis-based rate limiting for scalability

**Tasks**:
1. Implement rate limiting middleware
2. Add Redis for distributed rate limiting
3. Create rate limit monitoring
4. Add rate limit status to API responses
5. Create rate limit bypass for internal operations
