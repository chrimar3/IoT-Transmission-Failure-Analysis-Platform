# Story 3.3: Failure Pattern Detection Engine
**Priority**: P1 (Differentiation)  
**Effort**: 8 points  

**User Story**: As a maintenance manager, I want automated failure pattern detection so that I can prevent equipment failures and reduce downtime costs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Anomaly detection algorithms identify unusual patterns
- Predictive indicators for potential failures
- Pattern severity classification (Critical, Warning, Info)
- Historical pattern correlation analysis
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- Actionable recommendations for each pattern

**Tasks**:
1. Research and implement anomaly detection algorithms
2. Create pattern classification system
3. Implement confidence scoring mechanisms
4. Add historical correlation analysis
5. Create recommendation engine
6. Build pattern visualization components
