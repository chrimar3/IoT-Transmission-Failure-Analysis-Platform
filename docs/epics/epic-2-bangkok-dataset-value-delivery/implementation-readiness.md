## Technical Implementation Guide

### Component Architecture

```typescript
// Dashboard API Integration Pattern
const useBangkokDashboard = () => {
  const { data: summary } = useSWR('/api/readings/summary', {
    refreshInterval: 300000, // 5 minutes
    revalidateOnFocus: false
  })

  const { data: timeseries } = useSWR(
    `/api/readings/timeseries?range=${dateRange}`,
    { revalidateOnFocus: false }
  )

  return { summary, timeseries, isLoading, error }
}

// Statistical Display Component
interface ConfidenceInterval {
  value: number
  lower: number
  upper: number
  confidence_level: number
  p_value: number
}

const StatisticalMetric: React.FC<{metric: ConfidenceInterval}> = ({metric}) => (
  <div className="statistical-metric">
    <div className="value">{metric.value.toFixed(1)}%</div>
    <div className="confidence">
      95% CI: {metric.lower.toFixed(1)}% - {metric.upper.toFixed(1)}%
    </div>
    <div className="significance">
      p-value: {metric.p_value < 0.001 ? '<0.001' : metric.p_value.toFixed(3)}
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

### API Endpoints (Ready for Implementation)

```typescript
// Dashboard Data APIs
GET /api/readings/summary          // Bangkok dataset summary metrics
GET /api/readings/timeseries       // Time-series data with filters
GET /api/readings/patterns         // Pattern detection results
GET /api/insights/building-health  // Building health calculations
GET /api/insights/energy-savings   // Energy efficiency insights

// Export APIs (Professional Tier)
POST /api/export/pdf               // Executive report generation
POST /api/export/csv               // Raw data export
POST /api/export/excel             // Formatted workbook export
GET /api/export/status/{id}        // Export job status
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Caching Strategy**:
- Bangkok dataset (immutable): Aggressive CDN caching
- Statistical calculations: Pre-computed with 5-minute refresh
- User dashboard preferences: Session-based caching
- Export results: 24-hour retention for re-download

**Load Time Optimization**:
- Component lazy loading for dashboard sections
- Data decimation for large time range visualizations
- Progressive loading with skeleton UI components
- Memory management for extended chart interactions

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Testing Strategy

**Statistical Accuracy Validation**:
- Cross-validation with Bangkok University research team
- Independent statistical software verification
- Confidence interval calculation accuracy tests
- P-value computation validation against academic standards

**Performance Testing**:
- Dashboard load time benchmarking (<3s target)
- Chart interaction responsiveness (<100ms)
- Export generation performance (<30s standard reports)
- Concurrent user load testing (100+ simultaneous users)

**User Experience Testing**:
- Statistical concept comprehension testing (>80% target)
- Feature discovery rates (>70% find exports within first session)
- Mobile responsiveness for emergency dashboard access
- Accessibility compliance for statistical visualizations

### Risk Mitigation

**High Priority Risks**:
1. **Dashboard Performance**: Data decimation + progressive loading
2. **Statistical Accuracy**: Independent validation + peer review
3. **Export System Load**: Queue-based processing + rate limiting
4. **User Comprehension**: Plain English explanations + tooltips

**Contingency Plans**:
- Simplified dashboard mode for performance issues
- Direct line to Bangkok University team for statistical questions
- Manual report generation for critical customer exports
- Fallback static data for system outages
