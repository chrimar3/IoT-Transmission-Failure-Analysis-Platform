# Product Requirements Document: CU-BEMS IoT Transmission Failure Analysis Platform
## v4.1 - Production-Ready Commercial Service with Proven Architecture

---

## **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

• **Replace unvalidated assumptions with statistical validation** - Eliminate 35-40% error rates from hardcoded business assumptions
• **Identify potential savings opportunities** - Analyze 124.9M Bangkok sensor records to detect efficiency patterns where data quality permits
• **Provide regulatory-grade confidence intervals** - Deliver statistically significant confidence levels appropriate to data quality and effect sizes
• **Enable evidence-based facilities management** - Transform decision-making from estimates to data-driven insights
• **Demonstrate validation framework capabilities** - Use historical Bangkok dataset to prove concept for future real-time implementations

### **Background Context**

The CU-BEMS IoT Transmission Failure Analysis Platform addresses a critical industry problem: organizations making million-dollar energy efficiency decisions based on unvalidated hardcoded assumptions with 35-40% error rates. At Bangkok University, we have unprecedented access to 124,903,795 sensor records from 144 IoT sensors across 7 floors collected over 18 months (2018-2019). This complete dataset enables definitive statistical validation that replaces questionable savings projections with rigorous scientific analysis.

Unlike existing solutions (BuildingOS, EnergyCAP, Schneider Electric) that provide directional estimates, our platform delivers peer-review quality statistical analysis suitable for regulatory compliance and academic publication. The platform implements p-value testing, confidence intervals, and z-score analysis with multiple testing corrections to validate business metrics with unprecedented statistical power.

While this dataset provides unprecedented scale for IoT energy analysis, the platform's statistical validation approach is designed to be transparent about limitations, ensuring that confidence intervals accurately reflect data quality and that recommendations include appropriate caveats about transferability to other contexts.

## **Next Steps**

## **MVP Scope Definition**

### **Core Hypothesis to Validate**
**Primary Hypothesis**: Facility managers will pay €29/month for statistically validated building insights that replace unvalidated assumptions with regulatory-grade confidence levels.

**Secondary Hypothesis**: Bangkok University's 124.9M sensor dataset can demonstrate sufficient value to justify subscription pricing for building analytics.

### **MVP Core Features (IN SCOPE)**

#### **Essential Feature Set (Must Have)**
1. **Bangkok Dataset Access**: Complete 18-month historical data with statistical validation
2. **Executive Dashboard**: Building health overview, key alerts, performance metrics
3. **Basic Analytics**: Time-series charts, floor comparisons, equipment performance
4. **Professional Authentication**: Email/password login with subscription management
5. **Data Export**: CSV/PDF reports for executive presentations
6. **Mobile Responsive**: Emergency access to critical insights on mobile devices

#### **MVP Success Criteria**
- **Technical**: Dashboard loads <3 seconds, APIs respond <500ms
- **User Engagement**: >60% of users access dashboard within 48 hours of signup
- **Business Validation**: >10% free-to-paid conversion within 30 days
- **Value Demonstration**: Users export reports within first week (>25% adoption)

### **Deliberately OUT of MVP Scope**

#### **Deferred to Post-MVP (Phase 2)**
- ❌ **Real-time Data Processing**: MVP uses historical Bangkok data only
- ❌ **Custom Alerting**: MVP shows pre-configured alerts only
- ❌ **Multi-building Support**: MVP focuses on single building analysis
- ❌ **Advanced Machine Learning**: MVP uses statistical analysis only
- ❌ **API Access**: MVP provides web interface only
- ❌ **White-label Solutions**: MVP is CU-BEMS branded only
- ❌ **Enterprise SSO**: MVP uses basic authentication only

#### **Rationale for MVP Scope Decisions**
- **Focus**: Validate core value proposition (statistical validation) before expanding features
- **Speed**: Proven technical foundation allows 6-week MVP delivery
- **Learning**: Test willingness to pay for validated insights before building complex features
- **Risk**: Minimize development complexity while maximizing learning potential

### **MVP Learning Goals**
