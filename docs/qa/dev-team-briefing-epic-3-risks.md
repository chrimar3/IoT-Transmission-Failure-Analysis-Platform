# Development Team Briefing: Epic 3 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**Meeting Purpose**: Pre-Sprint Planning Risk Review  
**Date**: 2025-01-11  
**Epic**: Epic 3 - Core Analytics Dashboard  
**QA Architect**: Quinn  
**Product Owner**: Sarah  

## 🚨 CRITICAL RISKS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### **Cross-Epic Performance Pattern Identified**
The Bangkok dataset scale creates **systematic performance challenges** across ALL Epic 3 stories that must be solved architecturally, not per-story.

### **Dataset Scale Reality Check**
- **Total Data Volume**: 134 sensors × 100,000+ data points = 13.4M data points
- **File Sizes**: 215MB (2018) + 483MB (2019) = 698MB total
- **Peak Browser Load**: Without decimation = 5-15 second UI freeze
- **Mobile Impact**: App crashes on phones without proper data handling

- **Technical Issue**: Loading 100,000+ records into memory crashes server
- **Impact**: Professional tier feature fails, revenue impact
- **Required Mitigation**: Streaming exports, background processing

#### **Secondary Risk**: Email Delivery Reliability (55% probability)
- **Technical Issue**: Email service limitations, attachment size limits
- **Impact**: Professional feature unreliable
- **Required Mitigation**: Multiple providers, delivery confirmation, retry logic

**Development Priority**: Streaming architecture is foundational requirement

### **Story 3.1: Executive Summary Dashboard**
**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**

#### **Primary Risk**: KPI Calculation Performance (45% probability)
- **Technical Issue**: Real-time calculations across all sensors slow
- **Impact**: Dashboard loads slowly
- **Required Mitigation**: Materialized views, caching, background updates

**Development Priority**: Can proceed with standard optimizations

## 🏗️ REQUIRED ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATIONS

### **Phase 1: Performance Foundation (Must Complete First)**

#### **1. Data Decimation Architecture**
```typescript
interface DecimationStrategy {
  timeWindow: 'minute' | 'hour' | 'day' | 'week';
  maxPoints: number;
  algorithm: 'average' | 'min-max' | 'peak-detection';
  preserveAnomalies: boolean;
}
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Zoom-adaptive point reduction
- Preserve anomalies for pattern detection
- Multiple resolution levels pre-computed
- API endpoints for different detail levels

#### **2. Streaming Export Foundation**
```typescript
interface StreamingExportConfig {
  batchSize: number;        // Records per batch (default: 1000)
  outputFormat: 'csv' | 'excel' | 'json';
  compressionEnabled: boolean;
  progressCallback: (progress: number) => void;
}
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Server-side streaming with Node.js streams
- Client-side progress indication
- Memory usage monitoring
- Cancellation support

#### **3. Background Processing Architecture**
- WebWorker threads for pattern detection
- Service worker for offline capability
- Background sync for large operations
- Memory cleanup strategies

### **Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure Requirements**

#### **Bangkok Dataset Scale Testing**
```bash
# Performance benchmarks required
npm run test:performance -- --dataset=bangkok-full
npm run test:memory -- --threshold=150mb
npm run test:mobile -- --device=iphone-se
```

**Required Test Types:**
- Load testing with full 13.4M data points
- Memory leak detection during extended sessions
- Mobile device performance validation
- Professional tier subscription validation

## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY UPDATES

### **Performance-First Testing Approach**

#### **Continuous Performance Monitoring**
```typescript
// Required in all Epic 3 tests
describe('Bangkok Dataset Performance', () => {
  test('Handles full dataset without UI freeze', async () => {
    const dataset = await loadBangkokDataset({ size: 'full' });
    const renderTime = await measureRenderTime(dataset);
    expect(renderTime).toBeLessThan(2000); // 2 seconds max
  });
});
```
