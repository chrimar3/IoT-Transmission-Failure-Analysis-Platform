Date: 2025-09-12
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Comprehensive RLS implementation with multi-tenant isolation
- Performance: PASS - Clear targets with optimization strategy for time-series data
- Reliability: PASS - Proper error handling and recovery mechanisms planned
- Maintainability: PASS - Migration system and monitoring strategy defined

## Assessment Details

### Security: PASS
**Evidence:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented for multi-tenant data isolation
- User data isolation via subscriptions table linked to auth.users
- SSL/TLS encryption for all database connections
- No direct database access for client applications
- Audit logging for data access patterns planned

**Validation:**
- Free tier users limited to 10% sample data
- Professional tier users get full dataset access
- User-specific data access through subscription validation
- No hardcoded credentials or direct table access

### Performance: PASS
**Evidence:**
- Clear performance targets: <10 min bulk import, <500ms API responses
- Time-series optimization with BRIN indexes on timestamp columns
- Materialized views for daily/hourly aggregations to avoid real-time calculations
- Time-based partitioning strategy for 4-6M records
- Composite indexes for sensor_id + timestamp queries

**Validation:**
- PostgreSQL COPY command for efficient bulk import
- Pre-computed aggregations reduce query complexity
- Monitoring setup with 500ms slow query threshold
- Performance testing planned with realistic data volumes

### Reliability: PASS
**Evidence:**
- Migration scripts with rollback procedures
- Database connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Transaction rollback procedures for failed imports
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Connection pool monitoring and alerting

**Validation:**
- Database version tracking table for controlled updates
- Backup and recovery procedures documented
- Error handling for import failures
- Production monitoring with Supabase dashboard

### Maintainability: PASS
**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive migration system with version tracking
- Testing strategy with 100% coverage requirement for database utilities
- Clear documentation and code structure standards
- Monitoring and alerting setup for ongoing maintenance

**Validation:**
- Unit tests for database utility functions
- Integration tests for schema migrations
- Performance benchmarks for regression testing
- Structured file organization in scripts/ and src/lib/

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- Schema design is well-documented and follows PostgreSQL best practices
- Time-series optimization strategy is appropriate for the dataset size
- Multi-tenant security model is properly architected

### No Critical Issues Found
All NFR requirements have clear implementation plans and validation strategies.

## Performance Validation Strategy

### Bulk Import Testing
- Target: Complete Bangkok dataset (4-6M records) in <10 minutes
- Method: PostgreSQL COPY command with batch processing
- Validation: Performance testing with dataset subset

### API Response Time Testing
- Target: <500ms for 95th percentile of common queries
- Method: Materialized views reduce query complexity
- Validation: Load testing with realistic query patterns

### Query Optimization
- BRIN indexes for time-series data
- Composite indexes for filtered queries
- Partitioning strategy for large dataset management

## Security Validation Strategy

### Row Level Security Testing
- Verify user isolation between tenants
- Test subscription tier access restrictions
- Validate no data leakage between users

### Access Control Testing
- Test free tier limitations (10% sample data)
- Verify professional tier full access
- Validate authentication integration

## Quick Wins

- Performance monitoring is already planned with Supabase
- Migration system provides safe schema evolution
- Test coverage requirements ensure maintainability
- Time-series optimization strategy addresses scale requirements
