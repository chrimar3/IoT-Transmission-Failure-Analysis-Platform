## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### ARCH-001: Time-Series Schema Design for 4-6M Records
**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - Complex time-series data with 134 sensors over 18 months  
**Impact**: High (3) - Poor schema design causes permanent performance issues  

**Description**: Inadequate schema design for time-series data could result in exponential performance degradation as data volume grows, making the system unusable for analytics queries.

**Affected Components**:

- Primary key and indexing strategy
- Partitioning approach for time-series data
- Query performance for analytics
- Storage optimization

**Mitigation**:
- Implement time-series optimized schema with proper partitioning

- Implement table partitioning by time periods (monthly/quarterly)
- Add specialized time-series indexes (BRIN, GiST)
- Design schema for common query patterns (sensor aggregations, time ranges)

**Testing Requirements**:
- Load full dataset (4-6M records) and measure query performance
- Test schema with projected data growth (2-3x volume)
- Validate time-series query patterns meet performance requirements
- Test partition management and maintenance operations
