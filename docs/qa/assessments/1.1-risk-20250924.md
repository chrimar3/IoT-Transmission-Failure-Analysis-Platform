## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified**: 8
- **Critical Risks**: 2 (SEC-001, SEC-002)
- **High Risks**: 3 (PERF-001, DATA-001, SEC-003)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: OAuth Redirect URI Hijacking

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - OAuth redirect attacks are well-documented and easily exploitable attack vectors
**Impact**: High (3) - Complete account takeover leads to unauthorized access to €29/month Professional tier features, potential data breach

**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict redirect URI whitelist validation in Google OAuth configuration
- Add CSRF token validation for all OAuth state transitions
- Validate OAuth state parameter matches session state
- Use HTTPS-only redirect URIs with domain restrictions

**Testing Focus**:
- Penetration testing of OAuth flow with malicious redirect URIs
- State parameter tampering tests
- CSRF attack simulation during OAuth callback

### 2. SEC-002: Session Hijacking via XSS

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Authentication pages are high-value targets for XSS attacks
**Impact**: High (3) - Session hijacking enables unauthorized access to subscription management and analytics features

**Mitigation**:
- Implement HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite cookies for session management
- Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent script injection
- Sanitize all user inputs on authentication forms
- Escape all outputs in authentication templates

**Testing Focus**:
- XSS vulnerability scanning with OWASP ZAP
- Manual XSS testing on all authentication forms
- Session cookie security validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (Must Complete Before Deployment)

**Security Testing for Critical Risks:**
- **OAuth Security Tests**: Redirect URI manipulation, state parameter tampering, authorization code interception
- **XSS Vulnerability Tests**: Input injection on all authentication forms, stored XSS in user profiles
- **Session Security Tests**: Cookie security validation, session fixation attempts, concurrent session handling

**Required Test Types:**
- Automated security scanning (OWASP ZAP)
- Manual penetration testing
- Security code review focused on authentication flows

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests (Must Complete for Quality Gate)

**Performance Testing:**
- Load testing authentication endpoints under realistic traffic (95% success rate requirement)
- OAuth provider timeout handling and retry logic validation
- Database connection pool exhaustion scenarios

**Data Integrity Testing:**
- User profile synchronization between NextAuth and Supabase
- Transaction rollback testing for failed user creation
- Concurrent user registration stress testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests (Nice to Have)

**Business Continuity Testing:**
- Google OAuth service downtime simulation
- Fallback mechanism validation for email/password authentication
- User experience testing with multiple authentication options

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **All Critical Risks (Score 9)**: SEC-001, SEC-002 must be fully mitigated
- **High Security Risks**: SEC-003 rate limiting must be implemented with proper monitoring

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **Performance Risks**: PERF-001 acceptable with monitoring and alerting in place
- **Data Risks**: DATA-001 acceptable with transaction safety and rollback procedures

### Accepted Risks

- **Business Risks**: BUS-001 (Google OAuth downtime) - Accepted with email/password fallback
- **UX Risks**: UX-001 - Accepted pending user feedback and analytics

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

**Security Metrics:**
- Failed authentication attempts per IP (SEC-003)
- OAuth callback errors and redirect validation failures (SEC-001)
- Session security violations and cookie tampering attempts (SEC-002)

**Performance Metrics:**
- Authentication endpoint response times (PERF-001)
- OAuth provider API response times and timeout rates
- Database connection pool utilization and query performance

**Business Metrics:**
- Authentication success rates by provider type
- User registration conversion rates
- Session persistence and logout patterns

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- NextAuth.js or Supabase adapter versions are updated
- Google OAuth API changes or new security advisories
- Performance degradation reports from monitoring
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in authentication stack
- New authentication providers added to the platform

## Quality Gate Integration

**Deterministic Gate Mapping:**
- **2 Critical Risks (Score 9)** → Gate = **FAIL** (unless explicitly waived by security team)
- **3 High Risks (Score 6)** → Gate = **CONCERNS** (requires mitigation plan)
- **Overall Risk Score: 45/100** → **HIGH RISK** classification

**Recommendation**: This story requires **immediate security attention** before deployment due to critical authentication vulnerabilities that could compromise revenue-generating features.
