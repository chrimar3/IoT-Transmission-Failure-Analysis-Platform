## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### DATA-001: Data Loss During Bulk Import Operations
**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - Large bulk operations (4-6M records) with complex pg_copy integration  
**Impact**: High (3) - Data loss requires complete system rebuild and data reprocessing  

**Description**: Bulk import operations using pg_copy with 4-6M records could fail partially, causing data loss or corruption without proper transaction handling and validation.

**Affected Components**:
- pg_copy bulk import logic
- Transaction management
- Data validation pipeline
- Rollback mechanisms
- Import status tracking

**Mitigation**:
- Implement transactional bulk imports with all-or-nothing semantics
- Add comprehensive pre-import and post-import validation
- Create checksum validation for imported data integrity
- Implement incremental batch processing with transaction boundaries
- Add import progress tracking with automatic rollback on failures

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test complete 4-6M record import with validation
- Test import failure scenarios and rollback procedures
- Validate data integrity using checksums and row count verification
- Test import interruption and recovery scenarios
- Test concurrent import operations and transaction isolation

**Residual Risk**: Low - Transactional imports with validation significantly reduce risk

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex validation across large datasets  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Undetected data issues affect analytics accuracy  

### OPS-001: Rollback Procedure Complexity
**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Rollback from large imports is complex and time-intensive  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Failed rollbacks require manual intervention  

### MONITOR-001: Import Monitoring and Alerting Gaps
**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Comprehensive monitoring requires multiple metrics  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Poor monitoring delays issue detection and resolution  

## Low Priority Risks

### DEV-001: Development Environment Setup Complexity
