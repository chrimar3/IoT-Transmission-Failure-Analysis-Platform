*Generated by Quinn (Test Architect) - BMAD QA Agent*

## Overview
This document addresses the identified risks across all 11 pending stories and provides specific mitigation strategies to reduce risk levels before development begins.

## Risk Categories Identified

### HIGH PRIORITY: Medium Risk Stories (1 story)

#### Story 2.2: Stripe Subscription Integration
**Current Risk Level: MEDIUM (6/10)**
**Target Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM (4/10)**

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Payment Processing Complexity** - Multiple integration points with external service
2. **Security Requirements** - High stakes for payment data protection
3. **EU Compliance** - VAT and regulatory requirements complexity
4. **Business Impact** - Revenue generation depends on reliable payment processing

**Mitigation Actions:**

**IMMEDIATE (Before Development):**
1. **Stripe Sandbox Environment Setup**
   - Create comprehensive test environment with all webhook scenarios
   - Test all payment failure scenarios (declined cards, expired cards, insufficient funds)
   - Validate webhook signature verification with malformed requests
   - **Timeline: 1 day**

2. **EU VAT Compliance Validation**
   - Research current EU VAT digital services regulations
   - Validate Stripe's automatic VAT calculation for EU customers
   - Create test scenarios for different EU countries
   - **Timeline: 1 day**

3. **Security Testing Framework**
   - Create PCI DSS compliance checklist
   - Set up security testing for all payment endpoints
   - Validate zero local payment data storage
   - **Timeline: 1 day**

4. **Payment Failure Recovery Testing**
   - Design comprehensive payment failure scenarios
   - Test customer communication workflows
   - Validate subscription status consistency
   - **Timeline: 1 day**

**DURING DEVELOPMENT:**
1. **Incremental Security Testing** - Test each payment component as it's built
2. **Webhook Reliability Testing** - Continuous validation of idempotent processing
3. **Performance Monitoring** - Track payment processing times and reliability

**Risk Reduction: MEDIUM (6/10) → LOW-MEDIUM (4/10)**

### MEDIUM PRIORITY: Low-Medium Risk Stories (4 stories)

#### Story 2.3: Tiered Access Control Middleware
**Current Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM (4/10)**
**Target Risk Level: LOW (3/10)**

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Access Control Bypass** - Security vulnerabilities in tier validation
2. **Performance Impact** - Middleware adding latency to requests
3. **Session Management** - Complex integration with NextAuth.js

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. **Security Testing Plan** - Create comprehensive access control bypass testing
2. **Performance Benchmarking** - Establish <10ms middleware latency target
3. **Session Integration Testing** - Validate NextAuth.js session synchronization
**Timeline: 0.5 days**

#### Story 2.4: Rate Limiting by Subscription Tier
**Current Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM (4/10)**
**Target Risk Level: LOW (2/10)**

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Rate Limit Bypass** - Users circumventing tier limitations
2. **Performance Under Load** - Rate limiting affecting system performance
3. **False Positives** - Legitimate users getting rate limited

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. **Load Testing Plan** - Test rate limiting under high traffic
2. **Bypass Prevention** - Validate IP and session-based tracking
3. **Whitelist Strategy** - Create emergency access procedures
**Timeline: 0.5 days**

#### Story 4.1: Custom Alert Configuration
**Current Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM (4/10)**
**Target Risk Level: LOW (3/10)**

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Alert Fatigue** - Too many notifications reducing effectiveness
2. **Statistical Accuracy** - False alerts from improper threshold setting
3. **Notification Delivery** - Email/SMS delivery reliability

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. **Smart Filtering Design** - Implement alert deduplication and prioritization
2. **Statistical Validation** - Use Bangkok dataset patterns for threshold recommendations
3. **Delivery Redundancy** - Multiple notification channels with fallbacks
**Timeline: 0.5 days**

#### Story 4.2: Professional API Access
**Current Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM (4/10)**
**Target Risk Level: LOW (2/10)**

**Risk Factors:**
1. **API Security** - Unauthorized access to Professional features
2. **Rate Limiting** - API abuse and resource consumption
3. **Documentation Quality** - Poor developer experience

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. **API Security Framework** - Comprehensive authentication and authorization testing
2. **Rate Limiting Strategy** - Professional tier rate limiting (10K requests/hour)
3. **Documentation Standards** - Interactive API documentation with examples
**Timeline: 0.5 days**

### LOW PRIORITY: Low Risk Stories (6 stories)

#### Stories 2.1, 2.5, 3.1, 4.5
**Current Risk Level: LOW (2-3/10)**
**Target Risk Level: LOW (2/10)**

**General Risk Factors:**
1. **Technology Integration** - Standard integration complexity
2. **User Experience** - Interface usability and accessibility
3. **Performance** - Meeting response time requirements

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. **Technology Validation** - Verify all third-party integrations work as expected
2. **UX Testing Plan** - Create user journey testing scenarios
3. **Performance Benchmarks** - Establish clear performance targets and monitoring
**Timeline: 1 day total**
