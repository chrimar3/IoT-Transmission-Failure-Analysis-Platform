# Quality Gate Decision: Story 1.1 - NextAuth.js Authentication Setup
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect) on 2025-09-24

story_id: "1.1"
story_title: "NextAuth.js Authentication Setup"
epic: "Authentication & Revenue Foundation"
priority: "P0"
review_date: "2025-09-24"
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Gate Decision
gate_decision: "PASS"
gate_rationale: |
  All critical security vulnerabilities successfully resolved. OAuth redirect hijacking
  protection, XSS prevention via HTTP-only cookies/CSP headers, and rate limiting
  implemented with comprehensive test coverage. Authentication system is production-ready
  and secure for €29/month Professional tier revenue generation.
