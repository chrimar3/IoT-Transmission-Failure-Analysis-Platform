# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  While this implementation demonstrates exceptional technical quality with comprehensive
  features, enterprise-grade architecture, and excellent subscription integration, the
  lack of comprehensive test coverage for such a critical system component poses
  significant production risk. Alert systems must be thoroughly tested to ensure
  reliability and prevent operational issues. The CONCERNS gate reflects the need to
  implement proper test coverage before production deployment, after which this would
  easily achieve a PASS gate status.

final_recommendation: 'Implement comprehensive test suite then proceed to production. This is exceptionally well-built alert system that needs proper test validation.'
