## CROSS-STORY INTEGRATION VALIDATION

### Authentication & Authorization: ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**Professional Tier Gating**: Working Correctly
```typescript
// Pattern Detection (Story 3.3):
if (!isAdvancedUser && validatedRequest.sensor_ids.length > 5) {
  return 403 Forbidden  // ✅ Free tier limited to 5 sensors
}

// Export API (Story 3.4):
if (userTier === 'FREE') {
  return 403 Forbidden  // ✅ FREE tier blocked
}
```

**Rate Limiting**: ✅ **CONSISTENT**
- Both stories use same rate limiting infrastructure (Epic 1)
- Tier-based limits properly enforced
- Redis-backed sliding window algorithm

**Session Management**: ✅ **SECURE**
- NextAuth integration validated
- User ID extraction consistent
- Subscription tier checked on every request

### Data Flow Integration: ⚠️ **GAP IDENTIFIED**

**Current State**:
```
Bangkok Dataset → Pattern Detection (3.3) → UI Display
                                             ↓
                                          Manual Export

Bangkok Dataset → Export API (3.4) → PDF/CSV/Excel
```

**Missing Link**:
```
Pattern Detection Results → Export API (Direct Integration)
```

**Impact**: Low Priority
- Users can still export via UI
- Workaround exists
- Not blocking for MVP

**Recommendation**: Add in Sprint 2
```typescript
POST /api/export/patterns
{
  "pattern_ids": ["pattern_001", "pattern_002"],
  "format": "pdf",
  "template": "pattern_analysis"
}
```

### Epic 1 & 2 Dependency Validation: ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Epic 1 (Auth)**: ✅ Working
- Authentication integrated
- Subscription tier enforcement validated
- Rate limiting active

**Epic 2 (Bangkok Dataset)**: ✅ Working
- Pattern detection processes Bangkok structure
- Export includes Bangkok metadata
- Statistical validation preserved
